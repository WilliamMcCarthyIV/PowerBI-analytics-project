Snow Crab Population Dashboard

Overview
This repository contains the code and data for analyzing and visualizing the snow crab population in the Alaskan Eastern Bering Sea. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.

Power BI Dashboard Structure
The Power BI dashboard is organized into multiple pages, each focusing on different aspects of the snow crab population analysis:

1. Year-by-Year Slicer (1975-2018):
Description: A slicer allowing users to interactively select a specific year or a range of years (1975-2018) for focused exploration.

2. Metrics:
1. Total Crabs Caught per Year:
Description: Visual representation showcasing the total number of snow crabs caught each year. This metric provides an overview of the annual catch, highlighting any significant variations or trends over the years.

2. Average Catch Efficiency (CpUE):
Description: The CpUE, or catch per unit effort, is a metric representing the efficiency of crab catch. The average CpUE is calculated across all years, providing an overall measure of the effectiveness of crab trapping.

3. Average Surface Temperature (Gauge) and Bottom Temperature (Gauge):
Description: Gauge visualizations representing the average surface temperature and average bottom temperature. These gauges provide a quick and intuitive way to convey the average temperature values, offering insights into the environmental conditions during crab landings.

4. Depth Analysis of Hauls (Line Graph):
Description: A line graph illustrating the depth analysis of crab hauls. This graph displays variations in bottom depth across different hauls, helping to identify any patterns or correlations between crab abundance and depth.

5. Key Takeaways (Text)
Description: A text card describing the main trends of the datasets in a clear, concise way.

6. Geospatial Analysis (Map with Shaded Bubbles):
Description: A map visualization with shaded bubbles, showcasing the geographic distribution of crab hauls. The size or color of the bubbles may represent metrics like catch quantity or catch efficiency at different locations. This allows users to visually explore the spatial patterns of crab populations.
